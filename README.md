A fun experiment for Pi Day.

This is based on the video that StandUpMaths did on YouTube, which you can watch [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZBhSi_PwHU).

If you don't want to watch that, then I'll put it simply: This program attempts to approximate pi (yes, _the_ pi) using the probability that two random numbers are coprime.

Did that not make sense? Well, go watch the video. They did a great job.

It's quick and dirty, but it gets the job done. It will run until either it goes through every possible positive integer on your system (`sys.maxsize`), or until you hit `Ctrl+C`.
