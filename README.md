A fun experiment for Pi Day.

This is based on the video that StandUpMaths did on YouTube, which you can watch [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZBhSi_PwHU).

It's quick and dirty, but it gets the job done. It will run until either it goes through every possible positive integer on your system (`sys.maxsize`), or until you hit `Ctrl+C`.
